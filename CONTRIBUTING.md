# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Crypto.com Sample Chain Wallet. We try to make the process of contribution easy for you. But still there are some guidelines you have to follow.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcomed. You should post your request as [Github issues](https://github.com/crypto-com/sample-chain-wallet/issues/new) first. In an issue, please describe what your request is, the expected behaviour and how it will benefit you and/or other users.

Because the focus of this project is to provide a sample implementation of client wallet only. We may not be able to respond to your feature request issue promptly. However, you are free to submit a pull request by following the guidelines and we are happy to review it. Please check the [Working of issues](#working-on-issues) section for more details.

## Bug Reports

Bug reports should be posted as [Github issues](https://github.com/crypto-com/sample-chain-wallet/issues/new). In an issue, please describe what you did, what you expected, and what happened instead.

If you think that you have identified an issue with Sample Chain Wallet that might compromise its users' security, please do not open a public issue on GitHub. Instead, we ask you to refer to [security policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Working on issues

We use the variation of the "fork and pull" model where contributors push changes to their personal fork and create pull requests to bring those changes into the source repository.

Changes in pull requests should satisfy "Patch Requirements" described in [The Collective Code Construction Contract (C4)](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/#23-patch-requirements). We have provided [TSLint Rules](./tslint.json) for standardizing our code style, so please make sure to use `npm run lint` before every commit (e.g. by configuring your editor to do it for you upon saving a file). The code comments should follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#comments).

Once you identified an issue to work on, this is the summary of your basic steps:

* Fork Sample Chain Wallet repository under your Github account.

* Clone your fork locally on your machine.

* Post a comment in the issue to say that you are working on it, so that other people do not work on the same issue.

* Create a local branch on your machine by `git checkout -b branch_name`.

* Commit your changes to your own fork -- see [C4 Patch Requirements](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/#23-patch-requirements) for guidelines.

* Include tests that cover all non-trivial code.

* Check you are working on the latest version on master in Sample Chain Wallet official repository. If not, please pull Sample Chain Wallet official repository's master (upstream) into your fork's master branch, and rebase your committed changes or replay your stashed changes in your branch over the latest changes in the upstream version.

* If your changes are of interest to other developers, please make corresponding changes in the official documentation and the changelog.

* Push your changes to your fork's branch and open the pull request to Sample Chain Wallet repository master branch.

* In the pull request, complete its checklist, add a clear description of the problem your changes solve, and add the following statement to confirm that your contribution is your own original work: "I hereby certify that my contribution is in accordance with the Developer Certificate of Origin (https://developercertificate.org/)."

* The reviewer will either accept and merge your pull request, or leave comments requesting changes via the Github PR interface (you should then make changes by pushing directly to your existing PR branch).
